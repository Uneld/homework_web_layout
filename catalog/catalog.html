			<h2>Aperol Spritz</h2>
			<p>
				The Aperol Spritz is a very famous Italian cocktail people love to enjoy
				all year round, especially during summer. This refreshing, bright orange
				aperitif is very easy and quick to make, no one can resist
				its bittersweet taste. It is made with prosecco, the orange
				aperitif Aperol, and topped with soda. Garnish with an orange slice and
				enjoy one of the top Italian drink.
			</p>
			<p>
				Very popular especially in Northern Italy, the Aperol Spritz dates back
				to 1919, although its first traces were found at the beginning of the
				19th century. It was only from the 2010s that this cocktail became
				successful also in the rest of the world, when it became the perfect
				brunch drink because of its original taste and low alcoholic content
				(11% ABV). Try the Aperol Spritz as pre-dinner sipping to get you
				immediately into Italy.

			<h2>Negroni</h2>
			<p>
				The negroni is a cocktail, made of equal parts gin, vermouth rosso (red,
				semi-sweet), and Campari, generally served on the rocks, and commonly
				garnished with an orange slice or orange peel.[1] It is considered an
				apéritif.
			</p>
			<p>
				The drink is documented in Italy since the late 1940s, and became
				popular in the 1950s, but the origin is uncertain, and early recipes
				differ somewhat from the modern standard.[a] The basic recipe – an
				equal-parts cocktail of these three ingredients – is first recorded in
				French cocktail books of the late 1920s, alongside many similar drinks;
				in Italy a long drink of equal parts vermouth and Campari (but no gin),
				topped with soda and served over ice, has existed since the 1800s under
				the names Milano–Torino or Americano.
